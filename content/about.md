## **Hi! I'm Rafael Gude :)**

I'm a Software Developer, and I've been working in the area since 2017. I'm focused in backend, but I also had some experiences with frontend that I liked.

I created this blog to express some ideas about tech and life stuff, some experiences I've had, and some things that I'm currently studying.

My code snippets will be in Java because it's my most comfortable programming language. But I promise I'll try to keep the code as readable as possible for non-Java developers readers too.

Feel free to reach me through any of my social media to talk about my posts or something else :)
