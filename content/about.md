I'm a Software Engineer specialized in backend, but also with a little frontend experience. My expertise lies in the Java ecosystem.

I created this blog to express some ideas about tech and life stuff, some experiences I've had, and some things that I'm currently studying.

My code snippets will be in Java because it's my most comfortable programming language. But I promise I'll try to keep the code as readable as possible for non-Java developers readers as well.

Please feel free to reach out to me through any of my social media to talk about my posts or something else!
